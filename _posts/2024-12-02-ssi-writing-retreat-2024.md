## Pre-Meeting Checklist
Before we meet, make sure to do the following:
 - [ ] [Join the Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZY6MERJnn6) (Don’t forget to [set your nickname](https://appuals.com/change-nickname-discord/) so that we know who you are!)
 - [ ] **Make yourself unavailable.** Set an autoresponder on your email. Cancel as many meetings as you can. If you can only attend part of the retreat, that’s no problem – but it’s best to give yourself uninterrupted days if possible.
 - [ ] Mute messenger alerts and other common distractions.

If you have time, you may also want to:
 - [ ] **Brainstorm your goals for the retreat.** These don’t have to be particularly granular – it’s fine to just pick a project you want to focus on. Ideally, pick just one project where you can make significant strides. (If you have a zombie project that you’ve been struggling with, now’s a good time to move that forward!)
 - [ ] Set up your workspace.
 - [ ] Make a plan in advance for food. Consider batch cooking, inexpensive prepared foods, etc. The goal is to reduce your cognitive load during the retreat so that you can focus on writing.
 - [ ] Set alarms for the check-in meetings. These are listed on the agenda; I will schedule alerts on the Discord as well. (SSI folks: we will schedule around the SSI All Hands on Wednesday.)
 - [ ] Skim the [agenda.](http://KCollins.github.io/files/writing_resources/Writing Retreat Outline.pdf) Feel free to get a head start on the exercises on page 3.
 - [ ] Introduce yourself on Discord. See the instructions for this in the #introductions channel.
