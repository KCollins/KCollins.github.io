These are a few notes about thinkbox, its history, and my involvement with it. I'll probably add more here at some point. 


## Early Plans
The earliest stirrings of think[box] discussions were under the name "Case Idea Institute." I assume the name was changed because someone realized that could sound too much like "Quesadilla Institute." A missed opportunity? Perhaps.

My team's entry to the student design competition:

...Yes, it's in Prezi. It was 2011; leave me alone. Only three student design teams participated in the competition; our team won second place. It's something of a note of pride for me that just about everything on our list made it into the final building. The winning entry, as I recall, called for such amenities as a ball pit, a nap room, and a koi pond on the roof; these have yet to be installed. However, they did suggest the notion of a central staircase, which lives on between Floors 2 and 3.

The building renovation was by StudioTechne, the same architecture firm that renovated the Lee Road branch of the Cleveland Heights library back in 2006. You can see the shared DNA in the bridge to Veale, which resembles the bridge across Lee Road. (The former is named for Jim Wyant W7AH, great optical phyisicist and friend of W8EDU.) I visited their office on Euclid and met with the architects when we were putting our proposal together. I remember being concerned about whether the low ceilings would be able to accommodate a CNC.
